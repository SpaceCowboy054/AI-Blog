            As a computer science major, artificial intelligence is what people think of when it comes to computer science. This topic is immensely important as we progress as a civilization as can potentially decide our future if we don’t prevent against it now. We have gained an increased sensitivity towards privacy, anti data collection and AI generation in general. This blog will show the good, the bad, and the ugly of artificial intelligence.

            TLDW; The video goes over the theory of how artificial intelligence works. To put it simply, there are student bots and a teacher bot. The teacher bot grades the students according with a test and only the best of the best student bots go to the next stage. The tests are made by the human programmer by using data collected and specifying the right answer. This is why AI companies need large amounts of data. After the student bot with the best grade on the test is selected, some minor adjustments are made and rinse and repeat. Once the student bot has reached a certain threshold, there’s your algorithm. Overall, AI functions in a way that is highly questionable since not even the programmers that made it know how it works. This also poses some safety questions about how it can be applied in high-risk situations where the AI has a high variability.

        <h2>AI and it's current state in education</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence is currently a highly controversial topic in education. The general consensus is that it is being abused by students to practically “cheat” on assignments by not doing the work. Some professors and teachers have counteracted some of this by putting students’ papers through “AI detectors” but have been variable in results. Through personal experience I find that chat bots like ChatGPT is heavily reliant on the prompt given to it. If you give it the same prompt multiple times, it is likely going to spit out similar answers every time. This means ChatGPT has almost no variability when it comes to writing papers. ChatGPT also struggles with topics like math, physics, or chemistry. Because of the way AI is designed, it just guesses to get the right answer, in which it is almost never right. In its current state, ChatGPT and other AI chat bots are being used to help write papers but fail to provide much more academically to students.

        <h2>How AI Could Save (Not Destroy) Education</h2>
        <h4>-Sal Khan (Ted Talk)</h4>
        <p>
            In this video, Sal Khan introduces a chat bot that Khan Academy is currently developing to help students learn. He explains some very important properties of how AI can be better than a student teacher. First off, he explains that the AI bot doesn’t just tell the answer out-right but points the student in a direction that will help lead them to the right answer. Next, Khan explains that the bot can adapt to the student on the spot, by providing better examples to the student to help them learn more efficiently. Finally, it’s free so it can be provided to underfunded areas as long as they have internet access.

        <h2>Artificial Intelligence in Education: A Review</h2>
        <!--<p>citation: ???</p>-->
        <p>
            In comparison to Sal Khan’s video on AI chat bots, this paper provides some important contributions of how AI can be used in administration, instruction, and learning in education. In administration, AI can be used to grade exams, provide feedback, identify learning patterns for each student and assist lesson planning for teachers. In instruction, it can analyze students such as student growth and development and it helps in tailoring instruction to each individual student. In learning, it can provide help when creating course selection and schedules and can provide career paths given the student’s learning patterns or goals.

        <h2>Artificial intelligence in education: Addressing ethical challenges in K-12 settings</h2>
        <!--<p>citation: ????</p>-->
        <p>
            Since AI relies on large amounts of data, there are many problems that come from the collection and reliance of data to create AI bots. First is the ethical challenge of using peoples’ data without their knowledge or consent. Data privacy is a huge problem in today's age that is still being addressed through the government. Many people are wondering if it should be an unalienable right similar to how privacy was before AI. An additional problem is that data can have a bias, the person creating the tests for the bots can have a bias too. These biases will transfer from the human creating the tests or from the data and transfer into the bot itself. Obviously, having a biased artificial intelligence bot would pose many problems.

        <h2>Artifical intelligence in Education: Current Insights and Future Perspectives</h2>
        <!--<p>citation: ???</p>-->
        <p>
            This paper dives into many theories of how the world could function and how students could learn as technology and AI develops. The main topic of this paper is transhumanism, the process of body modifications. This is already being tested through things like Elon Musk’s Neuralink. As of late, the Neuralink has had its first human subject where the paraplegic has actually been playing a video game, Civilization 6 through the implant. [CITATION]. This can obviously be expanded and developed in the future by providing the Neuralink or other body modification with AI to help the student understand the topics being introduced to them more efficiently. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The paper also expands on transhumanism with the idea of an exocortex, a body modification that augments the brain. An exocortex would be capable of external memory, additionally systems, and other functions powered by AI. This exocortex would be able to provide real time feedback to the student while they are learning and would help increase education around the board.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Overall artificial intelligence is in its early stages and has a ton of room for improvement. If utilized correctly, it can be a powerful tool to help students learn, understand and visualize academic concepts like never before. It can also help on the teacher-side by providing important functionalities like grading exams, creating lesson plans, and providing student specific feedback. Artificial intelligence will definitely be improved but will take some time before it will truly be integrated into the American education system.
